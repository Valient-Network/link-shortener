# url.neumatic.ml
- a pretty easy to use url shortener  
- originally by [nelsontky](https://github.com/nelsontky/) and forked from [nelsontky/gh-pages-url-shortener](https://github.com/nelsontky/gh-pages-url-shortener)  
## how it works
1. You make an issue
2. Copy your issue ID
3. head to [http://url.neumatic.ml/[ISSUEID]](http://url.neumatic.ml/) and add the issue id in the place of [ISSUEID]. Very simple, thanks nelsontky!
